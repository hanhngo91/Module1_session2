                <p>One trip to the skincare aisle can have your head spinning by just looking at all the cleansers,
                    toners,
                    serums, and creams available. With so many options, it's easy to see how anyone can feel
                    overwhelmed.
                    The
                    truth is, a skincare routine doesn't need to be complicated in order to be effective.
                    In this article, you'll find expert tips and advice to help you put together a beginner's skincare
                    routine
                    that works for you.</p>

                <h2>Keep it simple</h2>
                <p>For beginners, we recommend starting with a basic three step routine—cleanse, moisturize, and apply
                    sunscreen. Of course, this can be modified, and products can be added depending on your individual
                    skincare
                    needs. For example, if you're struggling with acne, you may consider adding a spot treatment. No
                    matter
                    the
                    case, the core three steps remain as the foundation of a successful skincare routine.</p>

                <h4>What is a spot treatment?</h4>
                <p>A spot treatment, as you may already have guessed, involves targeting specific areas on your face to
                    help
                    address skin concerns such as blemishes, dark spots, age spots, sun spots as well as uneven skin

            <h2>Determine your skin type</h2>
            <p>One of the first steps on the road to building a skincare routine is determining your skin type.
                Different
                skin types have varying needs that need to be met by skincare products. Oily skin types may be more
                concerned with mattifying ingredients, as opposed to dry skin types that need thick and rich
                moisturizers.
                One easy way to determine your skin type is to observe your skin throughout the day. Is your skin shiny
                and
                oily by lunchtime, or dry and flakey in the morning? Whatever the case, these characteristics are
                indicative
                of your skin type.</p>
            <p>As dermatologists, we classify skin into four main types:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Oily skin: Skin that looks shiny due to an overproduction of oil.</li>
                <li>Dry skin: Skin with dry and flakey areas that may feel tight.</li>
                <li>Sensitive skin: Skin with red and irritated areas that are typically painful to the touch.</li>
                <li>Combination skin: Skin that has a combination of oily and flakey areas.</li>
            </ol>
        </article>

            <h2>Steps to follow</h2>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Step 1: Choose a cleanser</li>
                <li>Step 2: Find the right moisturizer</li>
                <li>Step 3: Don't forget about sunscreen</li>
                <li>Step 4: Pull it all together</li>
                <li>Step 5: Give your routine time to work</li>
                <li>Step 6: Consider routine enhancers</li>
